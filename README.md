Aims:

Effective utilization of state-of-the-art machine learning approaches is imperative for current academic and industrial jobs. This course is specifically designed to prepare the department students in data science and bioinformatics tracks to meet the evolving job market requirements. In particular, this course builds studentsâ€™ conceptual understanding of core machine learning algorithms and their interactions with different biomedical datasets. The course provides hands-on training on selecting the adequate machine learning algorithm for solving the underlying problem and effectively interpreting the corresponding results. The course aims to prepare the second-year department students to understand and practice the core machine learning algorithms in their thesis and final/future projects.

Description: 

This course suits bioinformatics and data science tracks. It develops the student's conceptual and applied insights to extract knowledge from biomedical datasets and tackle known modeling and data challenges. The course covers two main parts: most traditional machine learning methods and deep learning essentials. Although the course teaches the fundamental mathematics and statistical aspects behind each learning algorithm, it emphasizes how to develop and validate baseline and optimal models for practical biomedical applications. Students will learn to interpret results properly and conduct an effective error analysis while developing and validating models. Students will learn how to use the error analysis results to tune the learning algorithms for mitigating modeling and data challenges.
Student Background Skills: This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory. The student should know how to write programs using python. Hence, the student must take the department programming course and preferably the introduction to data science course to understand the core python libraries needed for developing machine learning algorithms covered by the course.
